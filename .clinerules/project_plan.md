        *   Describe the overall cybersecurity governance structure.
        *   Outline the risk management approach and appetite.
        *   Reference key policies (linking to where they might exist if not directly in `.clinerules`).
        *   *Potential Action:* Ask user/CISO Office/Compliance Manager.

        *   Summarize backup methods, locations, and frequency for critical systems (identified in Phase 1).
        *   Outline general procedures for data restoration validation.
        *   *Potential Action:* Ask user/Backup Administrators/IT Operations.

**Phase 6: Runbook Refinement & Optimization**
*   **Objective:** Continuously improve the clarity, efficiency, and robustness of existing runbooks based on operational experience and evolving capabilities.
*   **Tasks (Ongoing/Iterative):**
    1.  **Enhance Error Handling & Fallbacks:**
        *   Review `enrich_ioc.md` and other runbooks to add specific guidance for handling tool errors (e.g., "If GTI lookup fails due to quota, note limitation and rely on SIEM context").
        *   Suggest concrete alternative steps (e.g., "If primary SIEM search fails, try broader time window or alternative query structure").
        *   Integrate checks against `tool_rate_limits.md` before calling tools with known limits.
    2.  **Improve Context Integration:**
        *   Modify `triage_alerts.md` to suggest checking `common_benign_alerts.md`.
        *   Update investigation runbooks to prompt referencing `network_map.md` or `asset_inventory_guidelines.md` when assessing internal entity criticality.
    3.  **Refine Common Steps:**
        *   Analyze `enrich_ioc.md` - could it be split into `enrich_ip.md`, `enrich_domain.md`, etc., for more specific logic/fallbacks?
        *   Review other common steps for potential modularization.
    4.  **Clarify Decision Logic:**
        *   Refine assessment steps in runbooks like `triage_alerts.md` with specific examples (e.g., "If source IP is internal AND user is known admin AND target is domain controller AND time matches known patching window -> Likely BTP. Else -> Investigate further.").
        *   Explicitly link decision criteria to `incident_severity_matrix.md` where applicable.
    5.  **Standardize Reporting Outputs:**
        *   Define a standard "Key Findings" structure in `reporting_templates.md` to be used across triage, investigation, and hunt reports.
    6.  **Align with Personas:**
        *   Review runbooks like `deep_dive_ioc_analysis.md` or `advanced_threat_hunting.md` and add "*(Tier 2+/Tier 3 Recommended)*" annotations to particularly complex steps or tool usage.
    7.  **Incorporate Visualizations:**
        *   Update `case_event_timeline_and_process_analysis.md` to explicitly require a Mermaid process tree diagram in the report.
        *   Encourage adding simple relationship diagrams (e.g., `graph LR; Host-->IP; IP-->Domain;`) in investigation reports.
    8.  **Address Tool Limitations:**
        *   Ensure `find_relevant_soar_case.md` clearly documents the `list_cases` entity search limitation and suggests specific workarounds (manual search, SIEM correlation).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures runbooks remain effective, reflect real-world conditions, incorporate lessons learned (like tool errors), and leverage the full context available within the `.clinerules` directory.

**Next Steps:**

This plan outlines the creation of the suggested files. We can tackle these phases and tasks sequentially or prioritize based on which information would provide the most immediate value.

Would you like to start working on creating one of these files, perhaps beginning with Phase 1? Or would you like to adjust this plan? Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and toggle to ACT MODE when you're ready for me to start creating the files.
